# Exercism Research: Experiment 1 Track

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/research_experiment_1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/research_experiment_1)

This is a language track which holds the exercises for Exercism Research's first experiment.

## Exercises

All exercises in this track will be bonus exercises. This means that their `core` property will be set to `false` and the `unlocked_by` property set to `null` in the [`config.json` file](https://github.com/exercism/research_experiment_1/blob/master/config.json). Here's an [example exercise entry](https://github.com/exercism/research_experiment_1/blob/master/config.json#L10).

Each exercise must use the following naming format: `<track>-[1|2]-[a|b]`. The number part indicates which part of the exercise it represents (first part is start from scratch; second part is start with existing code). The letter part indicates which of the two exercises it is (remember: each track should have two exercises).

Each exercise in this repository must be unique, so copying exercises from another language is not an option.

These are examples of valid exercise names:

- `csharp-1-a` : first part of exercise A for C#.
- `javascript-2-b` : second part of exercise B for JavaScript.
- `ruby-1-b` : first part of exercise B for Ruby.

### Examples

The [`csharp-1-a`](https://github.com/exercism/research_experiment_1/tree/master/exercises/csharp-1-a) and [`csharp-1-b`](https://github.com/exercism/research_experiment_1/tree/master/exercises/csharp-1-b) exercises are working examples of exercises.
